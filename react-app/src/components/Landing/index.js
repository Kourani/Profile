                    Women in the engineering field have often had to challenge the stereotype that femininity and technical 
                    expertise cannot coexist. The notion that being "pretty" or fashionable undermines one's ability to excel 
                    in a male-dominated profession is outdated. On the contrary, the creativity, attention to detail, and innovative 
                    problem-solving that women engineers bring to their projects are unparalleled. I can wear a stylish outfit or have 
                    my nails done and still lead complex engineering projects because beauty and brains are not mutually exclusive—they 
                    can coexist and even complement one another.

                    Today I'm a second year graduate student working towards a master's degree in business administration. 
                    The master’s degree will enhance my skill set and pave way for stronger leadership and critical thinking skills. 
                    It will strengthen my ability to make tough calls at the right time and manage demanding situations. Overall, 
                    obtaining an MBA degree will provide a new perspective to business, teams and collaboration. It will certainly 
                    complement my bachelor’s degree and allow for further amplification of skills that may last a lifetime.
